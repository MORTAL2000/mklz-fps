# Fast Parallel Sort
By: Matthew Lee (mkl1) and Kevin Zhang (klz1)

## Summary

We are planning on competing in [15-210's Sorting Competition](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15210/sort.html) by Professor Guy Blelloch. In order to compete effectively, we are going to implement different parallel comparison-based sorts in a few languages and optimize for performance on the provided 72-core machine as well as run tests on a variety of other machine such as the unix machines, gates machines, latedays, and maybe the Xeon Phis.

## Background

Sorting is a classical problem in computer science. The challenge with sorting these days is how to correctly optimize the performance of different sorting algorithms on increasingly parallel and distributed machines. This competition was staged by Professor Guy Blelloch and the rest of the 210 team to incentivize students to help work on this real-world problem by writing efficient parallel sorting algorithms in a variety of languages.
