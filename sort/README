This is my implementation of a straightforward sample sort in Go.

It has been tested with the latest version (1.8) of the Go compiler.

It currently performs about 3.6x as badly as the provided C++ sample sort on the unix5 machine.

A "compile" script that simply runs "go build" inside the source directory is provided.

A "run" script of the same form as the provided "run" script has also been provided.
